```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

```{r}
## loading the necessary libraries

```


## Looking at the data
```{r}
health
health <- health %>% 
  drop_na()
health %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = steps_lag, y = weight)) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue1") +
  labs(x = "steps yesterday (in 1000s)",
       y = "weight (in pounds")

mean_wt_5ksteps <- health %>% 
  filter(round(steps_lag) == 5) %>% 
  summarize(mean(weight)) %>% 
  pull()


mean_wt_5ksteps

```
```{r}
health %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = steps_lag, y = weight)) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue1") +
  labs(x = "steps yesterday (in 1000s)",
       y = "weight (in pounds") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(4.5, 5.5), linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_point(aes(x = 5, y = mean_wt_5ksteps), size = 3, color = "red")
```
```{r}
health %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = steps_lag, y = weight)) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue1") +
  labs(x = "steps yesterday (in 1000s)",
       y = "weight (in pounds") +
  stat_summary_bin(fun = "mean", geom = "point", size = 2, color = "red", binwidth = 0.5)
```
```{r}
health %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = steps_lag, y = weight)) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue1") +
  labs(x = "steps yesterday (in 1000s)",
       y = "weight (in pounds") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red", size = 1.5) +
  stat_summary_bin(fun = "mean", geom = "point", size = 2, color = "indianred1", binwidth = 0.5)
```

## Lienar Models 

```{r}
fit <- lm(weight ~ steps, data = health)
fit
```

```{r}
library(broom)
augment(fit) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = steps, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point()
```
```{r}
coef(fit)
```

The coefficient on steps is `r coef(fit)[2]`
